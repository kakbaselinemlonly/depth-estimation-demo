# depth-estimation-demo

### ## Overview
#### This notebook demonstrates depth estimation using the Monodepth2 model by Niantic Labs. 
#### I experimented with downloading the official repository and running inference on sample images to visualize estimated depth maps.

#### The notebook includes setup commands for cloning the original Monodepth2 repo and loading its pretrained models.



#### Credits - This notebook uses the open-source implementation of [Monodepth2](https://github.com/nianticlabs/monodepth2) by Niantic Labs, licensed under the MIT License
#### This notebook was developed independently for learning purposes, based on my own implementation and public resources. 
#### It does not include any proprietary or team-specific materials.

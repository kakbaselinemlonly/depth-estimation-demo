# depth-estimation-practice-only

### ## Overview
#### This notebook demonstrates depth estimation using the Monodepth2 model by Niantic Labs. 
#### I experimented with downloading the official repository and running inference on sample images to visualize estimated depth maps.

#### The notebook includes setup commands for cloning the original Monodepth2 repo and loading its pretrained models.

#### Credits - This notebook uses the open-source implementation of [Monodepth2](https://github.com/nianticlabs/monodepth2) by Niantic Labs, licensed under the MIT License
#### This notebook was developed independently for learning purposes, based on my own implementation and public resources. 
#### It does not include any proprietary or team-specific materials.

Note:
This notebook was part of my learning process to understand depth estimation pipelines. 
I combined snippets from Monodepth2 examples with my own refactoring and testing code. 
Some portions were guided by open-source references and simplified for educational purposes.

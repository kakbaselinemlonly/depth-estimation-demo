## Depth Estimation Practice (Learning Purpose Only)

### Overview
This notebook demonstrates **depth estimation** using the open-source **Monodepth2** model developed by Niantic Labs (MIT License).  
I experimented with downloading the official repository and running inference on sample images to visualize estimated depth maps.

### Implementation
The notebook includes setup commands for cloning the original Monodepth2 repo and loading pretrained models.  
It also contains my own refactored code for data loading, preprocessing, and depth visualization — developed independently for learning purposes.

### Credits
- **Model Source:** [Monodepth2 by Niantic Labs](https://github.com/nianticlabs/monodepth2)  
- **License:** MIT License  
- This notebook was created solely for educational and non-commercial use.  
- No proprietary or team-specific materials are included.

### Note
This project was part of my personal learning process to understand depth estimation pipelines.  
Some sections were guided by open-source examples and simplified for readability and experimentation.
